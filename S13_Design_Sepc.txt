S13: Instructor exports data files for selected students.

Backend will parse and create a CSV file for each selected row. 
- The CSV file's name will be the selected row's student ID.
- The CSV will have one header row with "Student ID", "Last Name", "First Name", "Grade", and "Adjusted Grade". The second row will contain the actual data.
- All CSV files will be stored in a newly created folder with the following name, <Date>_Data_Files

HIDDEN DATA:
- Get and save selected row's student id, last name, first name, and most importantly the row number.
- Do a regex and replace all characters by empty spaces, as well as all numbers with more than 3 digits by empty spaces as well, since a student id is usually bigger than 3 digits.
- Since we know which row is the selected one, we can simply put back the selected row's student id, last name and first name in the correct row.
