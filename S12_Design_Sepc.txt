S12: Instructor exports student names, IDs, and grades as a CSV file with adjustment parameters.
Adjustment parameters: Average, Standard Deviation.
CSV imports original grades, as well as the adjusted average and adjusted standard deviation. 
CSV contains one table with student names, IDs, and original grades.
After the last row of the table, there is a line break which separates the second table which contains the adjustment parameters.
First row after the line break specifies Adjusted Averaged, which then is separated from the actual value (in the second row). 
The same procedure is followed for the next row which contains in the first column "Adjusted Standard Deviation", and the actual value in the second column.
